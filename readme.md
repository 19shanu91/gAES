```javascript
var whiteList = [{
                    user       : 'August Sander',
                    passphrase : 'abcDEF-123456-same-for-both-users'
                }]; 
```

- And August Sander have to configure it like this :
```javascript
var whiteList = [{
                    user       : 'Walker Evans',
                    passphrase : 'abcDEF-123456-same-for-both-users'
                }]; 
```
Save, refresh the gmail tab, et voil√† !

gAES encrypts your message on the fly, then decrypts all messages in the chatbox, every seconds (you can configure it).  
When reading chat history gAES adds a decrypt button to decrypt the encrypted conversation (yes).
